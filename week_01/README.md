My name is Allison Towey and I am a second year students in the Masters in Computational Social Science Program at the University of Chicago. I am originally from St. Paul Minnesota and I graduated with a Bachelors of Arts in Political Science from the Unviersity of Notre Dame in 2019. Following my undergradute degree, I worked as first a Product Manager and then a Government Relations Policy Analyst for an educational technology company based in Boston, Massachusetts. I decided to come back to school and focus on technology and politics, and I've enjoyed the journey thus far. This summer, I intered at Warner Bros Discovery and was able to see Machine Learning and Data Science more broadly in an entertainment and corporate setting. I did some work with Data Visualization in R (and took a class in college about the same), but I am excited to learn more about it and explore D3 and JavaScript!
