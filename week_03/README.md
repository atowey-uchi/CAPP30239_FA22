# WEEK 3 PROJECT 1: BAR CHART

##  Homework.HTML and Homework.JS form a practice bar chart of Library Visits in January 2022

This code creates a D3.JS Bar Chart comparing for library visits in January 2022 across various library branches in Chicago. To run this code, both files are necessary. In addition to the bare bones of the chart, it also includes:
- a Y-axis Title
- A Chart Title
- Exact Numbers on the Bars 

The output of this code looks like the following:

# WEEK 3 PROJECT 2: FINAL PROJECT DATA

## Final Project Topic:  How did the COVID 19 Pandemic Affect How Where We Go, How We Get There, and How This Affects Air Quality and Pollution?

### Data source 1:
## Trips By Distance
Bureau of Transportation (US Federal Government)
https://www.bts.gov/daily-travel

#### Description: 

This data shows the amount of people taking trips outside of their original place (home) during the pandemic, as well as how far they are traveling and for how long. Essentially, this data tracks how people left their homes during the COVID 19 pandemic and trends during the years.
*From Website:* "How many people are staying at home? How far are people traveling when they donâ€™t stay home? Which states and counties have more people taking trips? The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) now provides answers to those questions through our new mobility statistics. The Trips by Distance data and number of people staying home and not staying home are estimated for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics by the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland. The travel statistics are produced from an anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. All data sources used in the creation of the metrics contain no personal information. Data analysis is conducted at the aggregate national, state, and county levels. A weighting procedure expands the sample of millions of mobile devices, so the results are representative of the entire population in a nation, state, or county."


#### Why you are interested in this topic: 

COVID has changed out lives in many ways both instantaneously and delayed, short-term and long. I want to study how the pandemic affected our transportation and thereby our enviornment in 2020 and beyond.

####Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data: 

Animated map of how number of people traveling changed per day throughout the pandemic, line graphs comparing locations or distances.

####Potential data points: 

Columns about number of trips taken by time and by location.

#### Any concerns about the data: 

It has 3 Million rows, so it may be difficult to work with.

#### Identify if source is primary or secondary: 

Primary


### Data source 2:
## Air Quality Trends
Environmental Protection Agency (US Federal Government)
https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-national-summary#air-quality-trends

#### Description: 

This data shows the Air Quality Index for specific locations (counties) across the country from 1990 to today. It is broken down into different pollutants on their website, so it is possible I could drive more deeply into this specific dataset using the EPA's data.

#### *From Website:* EPA creates air quality trends using measurements from monitors located across the country.

#### Why you are interested in this topic: 

Pollution impacts our environment, weather, and public health, and I think it is of interest to all of us to know how our transportation choices may impact our planet.

#### Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data: 

In comparison with the data about travel (potentially maps or line graphs)

#### Potential data points: 

AQI by place by day

#### Any concerns about the data: 

There are a lot of different cities/CBSAs and pollutants missing, so the continuity of the data is potentially questionable.

#### Identify if source is primary or secondary:
Secondary

#### If secondary data, how you envision this data working with the primary source? 

It will be separate data that helps undersand transportation's effect on pollution.
